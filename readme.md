# pyUBX

This is a small but functional python wrapper for the u-blox M8 UBX protocol, as
defined in [UBX-13003221 - R13, §31](https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/products/documents/u-blox8-M8_ReceiverDescrProtSpec_(UBX-13003221)_Public.pdf). 

More precisely, it is a parser, message generator, message manipulator. It can also be used as a parser generator for other languages.

Only a small subset is currently implemented. However, this Python library was designed so that it is very easy to add messages.

For example, the `ACK-ACK` and `ACK-NAK` message format is defined in Python like this.

```python
@initMessageClass
class ACK:
    """Message class ACK."""
    _class = 0x05
    class ACK:
        _id = 0x01
        class Fields:
            clsID = U1(1)
            msgID = U1(2)

    class NAK:
        _id = 0x00
        class Fields:
            clsID = U1(1)
            msgID = U1(2)
```

The syntax is quite intuitive. UBX message class and message ID are defined by using member variables `_class` and `_id`. 

This design introduces some syntactic noise such as the frequent `class` keyword and the occasional decorator. It's an acceptable tradeoff: As it is correct Python it can therefore be used parse and manipulate messages. 

It is also possible to use these UBX message definitions to generate parsers and generators for other languages, such as C/C++, etc, by using introspection.

## What's implemented

- `ACK-ACK` `ACK-NAK` 
- `CFG-GNSS` `CFG-PM2` `CFG-PSM`
- `MON-VER`

## UBX

`UBX` is a "*u-blox proprietary protocol to communicate with a host computer*". There are

- 9 message classes `UPD ` `MON ` `AID` `TIM` `ESF` `MGA` `LOG` `SEC` `HNR` , and
- 155 individual messages, many of which have multiple versions
- `Command` `Get` `Set` `Input` `Output` `Periodic` `Poll Request` `Polled` 

## Usage

The two main classes are `UBXManager` and `UBXMessage`. They are defined in files with the same name.

### `UBXManager`

 `UBXManager` runs a thread that reads and writes to/from a `pyserial` device. It is assumed that a *u-blox* M8 GNSS module is connected to the serial port. 

```python
import serial
from UBXManager import UBXManager
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyAMA0', 9600, timeout=None)
manager = UBXManager(ser, debug=True)
```

The manager thread is then started like this:

```python
manager.start()	
```

By default `UBXManager` dumps all `NMEA` and `UBX` messages to stdout. By deriving and overriding the member functions `onNMEA`, `onNMEAERR`, `onUBX`, `onUBXErr` this behaviour can be changed.

### `UBXMessage`

`UBXMessage` parses and generates UBX messages. The `UBXMessage` classes are organized in a hierarchy so that they can be accessed with a syntax that resembles u-blox' convention. For example, message `CFG-PSM` corresponds to Python class `UBX.CFG.PSM` and its subclasses.

The subclasses capture the message format variations that are used for requesting and receiving. So, the `Get` message of `CFG-GNSS` is

```python
> UBX.CFG.PMS.Get().serialize()
b'\xb5b\n\x04\x00\x00\x0e4'
```

# Types

Types are defined in `Types.h`. Currently there are the following:

`U1`, `I1`, `X1`, `U2`, `I2`, `X2`, `U4`, `I4`, `X4`, `R4`, `R8`, `CH`, `U`

and they correspond exactly to the ones defined by u-blox in §31.3.5.

Simple types are defined like this:

```python
@_InitType
class I4:
    """UBX Signed Int."""
    fmt   = "i"
    def ctype(): return "int32_t"
```

The decorator `@_InitType` does most of the work: It implements the `__init__`, `__parse__`and `toString` functions and adds the `_size` variable. The `_InitType` decorator needs the `fmt` class variable to be defined, the letter corresponds to the code used in the Python `struct` module.

## Protoyping with Python

It is unusual to interface with a chip using Python. Usually this is done in C/C++ using a microcontroller, maybe an Arduino. 

However, it is desirable to use a high-level language in the early stages of a project where it is key to quickly

- learn the interface/protocol,
- test new products (chips, modules, antenna configurations),
- cobble together prototypes or some mobile test-kit

#### Interfacing

The standard serial interfaces, such as UART, I<sup>2</sup>C, SPI, are easy to use with the appropriate USB-to-XYZ adapters.

#### REPL

The Python shell (or even better: [IPython](https://ipython.org/)) provides a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) that allows to interactively explore the protocol and the behaviour of the chip.

#### SBCs

For field tests single board computers (SBCs) can be used. Some draw less than 200mA, so a 5Ah USB power bank is more than enough for a day's work. A default choice is the ubiquitous Rasperry Pi. The community is huge and libraries are plentiful. But with only one each of UART, SPI, I<sup>2</sup>C it's not necessarliy the best choice for prototyping. Some alternatives are

- **[C.H.I.P](http://getchip.com)**: Very cheap, with on-board flash, and with slightly more I/O than the Raspberry
- **[Beaglebone Black](https://beagleboard.org/black)**: Well equipped with on-board flash, 2 x SPI, 2 x I<sup>2</sup>C, 4 x UART, etc., but not so cheap (around 50$).
- **[Pine64](https://www.pine64.org)**: Rather large and power hungry (300-800mA current draw), but cheap yet powerful with a quad-core A64 processor and [generous I/O](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0cEs0lxTtL3YU1CNmJ2bEIzTlE/view).
- [**UDOO Neo**](https://www.udoo.org/docs-neo/Introduction/Introduction.html): i.MX 6SoloX-based with 3 x UART, 3 x I2C, but only 1 x SPI. The basic version is about 50$.

#### Typical setup

Here's what we used for testing:

- SBC: Raspberry Pi
- GNSS: CAM-M8Q module on carrier board (80x40mm ground plane), connected via UART
- Power consumption measurement: [INA219](http://www.ti.com/product/INA219) module, connected via I<sup>2</sup>C

## Outlook

### Todo

- Manipulators
- Support for bitfields
- Add type `RU1_3` as defined in §31.3.5

## Alternatives

The UBX protocol takes up about 220 pages of the *Receiver Description*, so is rather extensive and it would have been nice to rely on prior work.

### Kaitai

[kaitai](http://kaitai.io looks very promising and would have been a great fit. But, unfortunately, Kaitai can only create parsers (readers)  and it does not allow to create writers and manipulators. We'll look again at Kaitai when this limitation is lifted. Since the `pyUBX` message definition is written in Python it shouldn't be difficult to generate the necessay `.ksy` yaml files automatically.

### arobenko/ublox

This is a C++11 library available on [github](https://github.com/arobenko/ublox). It is quite comprehensive and relies on the Qt framework which is not an option for most microcontrollers.
